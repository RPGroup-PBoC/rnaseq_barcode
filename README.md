# Using Sequencing as Quantitative Tool for Gene Regulation

This repository contains all the code and tools used to study sequencing as a tool to quantitatively study gene expression.

## **`code`**

Where all the *executed* code lives. This includes pipelines, scripts, and figure files.

* **`processing`**: Any code used to *transform* the data into another type.
  
* **`analysis`**: Any code to *draw conclusions* from an experiment or data set.
  
* **`exploratory`**: A sandbox where you keep a record of your different approaches to transformation, interpretation, cleaning, or generation of data.
  
* **`figures`**: Any code used to generate figures for your finished work, presentations, or for any other use.

## **`data`** 

Contains small data files and locations for large files.

* **`protocols`**: A well annotated and general description of your experiments. These protocols should be descriptive enough for someone to follow your experiments independently 

## **`rnaseq_barcode`**

Custom Python code used in this project. Can be installed as Python package.

## **`tests`**

All test suites for your code. *Any custom code you've written should be thoroughly and adequately tested to make sure you know how it is working.*

## **`templates`**

Files that serve as blank templates that document the procedures taken for each experiment, simulation, or analysis routine.
