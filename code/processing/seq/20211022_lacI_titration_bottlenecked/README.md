# 2021-10-22 Sequencing run

## Purpose
This experiment was onducted on an Illumina MiSeq in Matt Thomson's
laboratory. We used an Illumina MiSeq v2 Micro kit (300 cycles). We sequenced



## Platform
MiSeq system (Thomson lab)

## Sequencing kit
MiSeq Kit V2. Micro (300 cycles)

## Sequencing Modality
Single-end read (75 cycles Read 1, 8 cycles Index Read 1)

## Library Preparation
For this experiment we bottlenecked the library by plating the sublibraries on LB+kan plates and scraping
about 100 colonies with the intention to get 100 barcodes. The scraped colonies were than treated and prepped
as normal.
