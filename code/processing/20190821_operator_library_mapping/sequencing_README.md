# 2019-08-21 Sequencing run

## Purpose
Mapping the O1, O2 and O3 oprator library barcodes to the corresponding set 
of random barcodes.

## Platform
MiSeq system (Thomson lab)

## Sequencing kit
MiSeq nano kit V2. (300 cycles)

## Sequencing Modality
Paired-ends reads

## Materials

| **id** | **barcode-sequence** | **description** |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| index-1 | CAGTACAT | Technical replica for sequencing |
| index-2 | ACTAGCAT | Technical replica for sequencing |

## Notes and Observations
This is our very first sequencing run. We were helped by Jeff Park from the 
Thomson lab. He taught us how to operate the MiSeq and how to load the samples
into the machine
